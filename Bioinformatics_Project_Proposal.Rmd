# Overview of Proposed Project

## Questions

I will look into the probiotics that can be found in fermented food and beverages and its survival rate under different storage conditions.

## Hypothesis

If fermented food and/or beverages are stored at room temperature, the number of probiotics will be dramatically decrease because the survival rate of the probiotics is highly dependable on the temperature of the storage [@heller2001probiotic].

## Study Design

Samples will be obtained from three different fermented food and beverage; wine, yogurt, and miso. The first treatment group will be immediately refrigerated after purchase and the second group will be stored at room temperature. Each sample will be obtained after 72 hours from the time it was stored.
