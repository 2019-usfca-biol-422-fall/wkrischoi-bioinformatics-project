I will look into the microorganisms in ground pork under different storage conditions.

## Hypothesis


## Study Design

Samples will be collected from three different fermented food and beverage; wine, yogurt, and miso. All samples will be purchased from a local grocery store. Samples will be immediately refrigerated after purchase. Once the experiment begins, the first treatment group will be remain refrigerated and the second group will be stored at room temperature. Subsampling will be performed after 72 hours from the time it was stored.

### Materials needed for Subsampling

* 6 sterile tubes
* 6 disposable spatulas
* Lysis buffer
* Gloves

### Timeline for Subsampling

1. Purchase samples before 3 Sep and keep the samples in a 4 degree celcius fridge.
2. Start the experiment on 
3. Collect the sample on
