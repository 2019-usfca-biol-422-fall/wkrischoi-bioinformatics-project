# Overview of Proposed Project

## Questions

I will look into the probiotics that can be found in fermented food and beverages and its survival rate under different storage conditions.

## Hypothesis

If fermented food and/or beverages are stored at room temperature, the number of probiotics will be dramatically decrease because the survival rate of the probiotics is highly dependable on the temperature of the storage [@heller2001probiotic].

## Study Design

Samples will be collected from three different fermented food and beverage; wine, yogurt, and miso. All samples will be purchased from a local grocery store. Samples will be immediately refrigerated after purchase. Once the experiment begins, the first treatment group will be remain refrigerated and the second group will be stored at room temperature. Subsampling will be performed after 72 hours from the time it was stored.

### Materials needed for Subsampling

* 6 sterile tubes
* 6 disposable spatulas
* Lysis buffer

### Timeline for Subsampling

1. Purchase samples before 3 Sep and keep the samples in a 4 degree celcius fridge.
2. Start the experiment on 
3. Collect the sample on
